    "summary": "The Restaurant Rater project is intended to be a clone site of a very popular review forum, Yelp. It is built using the PERN stack.\n\nI specifically used PostgreSQL to steer away from document-oriented NoSQL databases. I plan to learn how to utilize cloud-based storage products like AWS to deploy my projects to the web using PostgreSQL.\n\nThis project was the first project where I learned how to handle client requests and manage database operations."
