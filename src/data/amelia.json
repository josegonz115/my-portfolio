    "summary": "I took part at IrvineHacks 2024 at my university UCI where me and three other companions built an Internet of Things companion called Amelia. We gave \"gemini\" the ability to see, hear, talk, and walk. She can communicate about landmarks all over the world, and follow you around using her camera and motor.\n\nI personally programmed Amelia's software end, utilizing an event-driven loop to bring all the speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and photo-to-speech cohesively together. The processes involve different Python libraries such as OpenCV for utilizing the camera to analyze people to AI/NLP APIs such as Whisper by OpenAI. I took part in also aiding the prompt engineering effort prime the Gemini model into acknowledging its role as a tour guide companion.\n\nIt was my first hackathon project which I'm glad to say was a success. Not only did our project win Hacker's Choice, but I learned a lot about working under a strict deadline and calling last minute audible decisions to do alternative approaches when initial design does not go as expected!"
