    "summary": "In my web applications course, INF 134 at UCI, we were tasked with a quarter long team project to create a full stack web application. I took this opportunity to propose using technologies such as Next.js and AWS to store and serve our images to the frontend. My team accepted the challenge as long as I were to take the lead in introducing them to these new technologies. I took this challenge despite not utilizing them before. We were able to decouple the backend and frontend, per courseâ€™s project requirement, and succeeded in hosting, serving and rendering foodie reviews alongside with their locations with help from various apis. \n\nMy favorite part was interacting with AWS technologies to create CDNs through CloudFront, creating Lambdas to use in unison with our two S3 buckets. One for storing the original images and one for storing modified images triggered and created by lambda functions. These modified images worked alongside the CDN to cache resized images to increase usability and user experience with our web application.\n\nThroughout my projects so far, I believe this is the project that solidified my knowledge with creating and managing backends and databases. Thankfull for the struggle and perseverance me and my team went through"
